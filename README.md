# //NOTES
### Bugs are to be expected, not every encounter reward is included, meaning there is a chance for it to freeze up on that screen.
### Lots of features to come, including fusing, gift enhancement, ego gift reward choice, auto ego use based on struggling/hopeless, team customization, MD count and starting star gift customization.
